# Changelog

This file records the changes to multiverse, mxv and mxv-phase that a
workspace may need to act on.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- A sandboxed process can connect over loopback only to the units that its
  `permissions.connect` names. Before this change the sandbox opened the
  ports of every unit in the process's `depends_on`, and `connect` was only
  checked to name units of `depends_on`. A workspace whose sandboxed
  process reaches a dependency that its `connect` leaves out must add that
  unit to `connect`; otherwise the process's connections to it fail with
  "Operation not permitted" on macOS.
